  <h1>Osteomyelitis</h1>
  <p>Osteomyelitis is an infection in a bone. It can reach a bone by traveling through the bloodstream or spreading from nearby tissue. Infections can also begin in the bone itself if an injury exposes the bone to germs.</p>
  <p>Common symptoms include fever, chills, fatigue, and bone pain. Diagnosis often involves blood tests, imaging, and sometimes biopsy. Treatment includes antibiotics and sometimes surgery.</p>
